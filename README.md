This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native development: unhandled promise rejections. The `DataList.js` file contains a fetch call that doesn't properly handle potential errors, leading to a silent failure or app crash. The solution, in `DataListSolution.js`, adds comprehensive error handling using try...catch blocks and the `finally` block to ensure the loading state is updated regardless of success or failure.
